# Simple Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a simple, user-friendly calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations and features an interactive UI.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Percentage
- Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) functionality
- Responsive and intuitive user interface
- Real-time calculation display

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the calculator
- **CSS**: Styles the buttons, layout, and overall appearance
- **JavaScript**: Implements the calculator logic and user interactions

## File Structure
```
ðŸ“‚ Simple Calculator Project
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css       # Styling for the calculator
â””â”€â”€ app.js          # JavaScript logic for calculations
```

## How It Works
1. **User Input Handling**: Button clicks update the expression displayed on the screen.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The expression is parsed to extract numbers and operators.
   - Operations are performed sequentially.
3. **Result Display**: When the `=` button is pressed, the expression is evaluated and displayed.
4. **Clear & Delete Functions**:
   - `AC` resets the calculator.
   - `DEL` removes the last entered value.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click the buttons to perform calculations.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement keyboard support for better usability
- Add scientific calculator functions (sin, cos, log, etc.)
- Improve UI with animations and themes
